## Overview

This project is a **modern React frontend** with smooth animations and an interactive form paired with a **FastAPI backend** powered by **Prisma ORM** for database management. It demonstrates asynchronous communication through Axios from frontend to backend for creating and fetching user data.

---

## Features

- Responsive React UI with animated particles and fade effects  
- Form to register sorcerers with name, age, and bloodline holder  
- List view with animated and styled cards of all registered sorcerers  
- Backend API with FastAPI for POST and GET user operations  
- Prisma ORM integrates management of user records with a database  
- Cross-origin requests handled via FastAPI CORS middleware  
- Clean separation of frontend and backend codebases with Axios integration  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Axios, Tailwind CSS (for styling)  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Prisma ORM, Python 3.9+  
- **Database:** (As per your Prisma configuration, e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite)  
- **Other:** CORS middleware, async/await for asynchronous operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm/yarn installed  
- Python 3.9+ installed  
- Database setup as required by Prisma  

### Installation

**Backend**

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your database and Prisma
prisma generate
uvicorn main:app --reload



**Frontend**

cd frontend
npm install
npm start



---

## Usage

1. Navigate to the frontend app in your browser (usually `http://localhost:3000`).  
2. Use the form to register new sorcerers with a name, age, and bloodline holder.  
3. Submit and navigate to the "Registered Sorcerers" page to view existing sorcerers.  
4. The list fetches live data from your FastAPI backend and updates dynamically.
